        "Throwing bowling balls at a left angle will cause the least amount of pins knocked over. In the first throw, throwing straight and right had the highest mean at 6.1 pins knocked over, whereas throwing balls left has a mean of 4.7 pins. In the second throw, 1.7 pins were knocked over for throwing straight, 1.7 for throwing right, and 1.3 for throwing left. Becuase throwing straight and right have about the same mean in both throws, throwing the ball to the left always had a significant decrease in the amount of pins knocked over compared to throwing the ball to the right or straight."

In the second throw, the data follows a similar trend with a mean of 1.5 pins knocked for throwing the ball fast, 2.0 pins for throwing the ball slowly, and 1.4 pins for throwing at a medium speed. The standard deviation for the 2nd slow throw is 1.7 however, so the median of 1.5 pins should be a better measure. Becuase there is so much data for throwing the ball fast compared to the other speeds and the first fast throw has a much larger differnce of pins knocked over compaed to the medium and slow throws, throwing the ball fast will cause the most amount of pins knocked over, followed by throwing the ball at a medium speed, and the least amount of pins knocked over through throwing the pin slowly."
